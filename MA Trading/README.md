Using Pandas and DataFrame, I implemented a basic stock trading strategy that reads a CSV file with historical trading data of a stock, 
plots moving averages with the stock price, and determines if the user should long or short the stock. 

To change the stock that we are tracking, the user must download the trading data from Yahoo Finance in a csv file and insert it into the program. I am currently implementing a way to take in the data via user input.
