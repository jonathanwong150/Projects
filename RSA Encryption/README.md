To compile my program, run "make" in the terminal and then ./rsa followed by two large prime numbers in the commmand line. The program will then run and prompt the user for a command.

RSA Encryption is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission. In this program, I emulated this system using modular exponentiation, the Euclidean algorithm, and file input/output.
