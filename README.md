Hi! My name is Jonathan Wong and I am a junior at the University of Southern California studying computer science and business. This repository is full 
of my projects from class and side projects that I worked on in my own time. I love exploring different aspects of programming and I hope to continue my growth
as a developer and as a person. Feel free to take a look at my work!
