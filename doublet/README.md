The game "doublet" is a word transformation puzzle. The goal of the game is to get from a starting word to an ending word, changing only one character at a time. 
To complete this, I created a d-ary heap class and implemented an A* searching algorithm that would find the shortest path from start to finish given a bank of words.

To compile my program, run "make" in the terminal and then ./doublet followed by start word, end word, and .txt bank file in command line.
The program will then run and print the amount of steps and expansions to get from the start to end word.
