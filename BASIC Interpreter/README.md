To compile my program, run "make" in the terminal and then "./interpreter" 
Once this runs it will ask the user for an input file.

BASIC is a well-known limited programming language that has a set of commands such as "PRINT", "GOTO", and "LET". I developed an interpreter that will read a .txt file of BASIC commands using inheritance and object-oriented programming principles.
