To compile my program, run "make" in the terminal and which will compile two programs. To run these programs, run ./birthday and 
./proberate

birthday.cpp will show the birthday problem using the hashtable which will result in around a 50% that our first collision happens within the first 23 inserts

proberate.cpp will show the average amount of probes given a set number of inserts.
